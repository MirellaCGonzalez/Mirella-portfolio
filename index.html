        <h3>About Mirella</h3>
            <p> In my prior work and while attending San Francisco State University, working with others was necessary to accomplish group projects and tasks. It allowed me to listen to other ideas and thoughts as well as give my ideas and inputs.  I believe sharing ideas, team work and collaboration with others provides a deeper, better experience with coding and mostly anything else in life, for that matter. My willingness to work with others allows me to brain storm, collaborate and be interactive with different people.
            I’m passionate about Web Development because it allows me to solve problems and be creative at the same time.  I like the fact that there is more than one way to solve a problem by looking for creative solutions, which challenges me to think outside the box.  I enjoy creating something from scratch or finding solutions to improve something which is challenging but very rewarding. 
            I can finally put my creative side to work. I’m currently a student at Thinkful/BLOC and I find fulfillment in going from a blank text editor to a fully working site.</p>
           <p>In my free time, I enjoy spending time with my family.  I love trying new foods, listening to music, movies and traveling as much as possible.</p>
